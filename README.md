# stock_data

Python script to scrape dynamic stock data and automate the script to run continuously every 15 minutes to replace/update the previously scraped data. Save in an sqlite3 database table. 

In all corporate jobs you will do some or all of your work interacting with web applications (clicking, filling forms, downloading files). Automating repeated tedious tasks with webscraping bots is one of my favorite tools.
